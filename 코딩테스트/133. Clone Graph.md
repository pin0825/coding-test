- **난이도**: (, Medium, )


### 문제 요약![[스크린샷 2024-12-30 오후 8.55.38.png]]
-

### 제약 조건
- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.


1.make list for visited dic
2.make clone for node. and check if the node is a node alreay visited and save into the visited dic
3.and set neighbors for in current_node.neighbors and append to node
