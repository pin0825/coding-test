i love learning forien langugages. in fact, i love it so much that i like to learn a new language every two years. currently working on eighth apron
people find that out about me they always ask me how did you do that? whats your secret
and to be honest, for many years, my answer would be i dont know i simply love learning languages
poeple were never happy with the answer. they wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language never achieveing fluency.\
and here i come learning one language after another
they wanted to know the secret of the polygrots people who speak all of the languges.
and that made me wonder too, how do i actually other polygrots do it.
what do we have in  common. and what is it that enables us to learn language so much faster than other people
