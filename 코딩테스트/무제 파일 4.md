best place to meet a lot of ployglots is an event where hunderds of language lovers meet in one place to practice thier languages.
there are several such polrygrot events organized all around the world and so i decided to go there and asked polygrots about the methods that they used.
so i met benny from 아일랜드 who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one. he learns a few phreases from a travel phrease book. 
and goes to meet native speakers and start having conversation with them right away
 he doesnt mind making even two hundread mistakes a day because thats how he learns based on the feedback
and the best thing is he doesnt even need to travel a lot today because you can easily have converstions with native speakers from the comfort of  your living room using websites.
